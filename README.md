# Coord_Trans

Coordinate transformations between the Finnish KKJ and EUREF-FIN systems.

To use the code, download **eureffin.py** and **tm.py** and import them.

The figure below helps in finding the combination of function calls needed to transform coordinates from one system to another (see, e.g., **tests_helsinki.py**).
